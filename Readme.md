# Computer Vision with Deep Learning

Hello and welcome to this series of tutorials. This is a six-session boot camp to cover the basic concepts of computer vision and gain hands-on experience working on various CV tasks.

First things first, let's differentiate between computer vision and image processing.

Image processing is interested in raw image enhancments via tuning its parameters or applying different filters. When you are doing image processing you are performing tasks such as sharpening, smoothing, bluring, correcting illumination, etc. It can be either an independent task or preprocessing part of a larger task.

Computer vision is a superset of image processing. It is interested in how computers see and process image information to have a proper understanding. That's why it comes along with Machine learning techniques and deep learning to conduct some kind of detection, classification, recognition etc.

What we will focus on during our journey is Deep Computer Vision Using Convolution Neural Networks. But, first we would go through some fundamental concepts such as convolution and filtering. And, we shall practice using openCV library to be able to handle and preprocess image data.

## Assignment:

Cat and dog classification photos. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data). You are required to start with a baseline model, trying to introduce some improvements to enhance the model performance, then using transfer learning to boost it up to 90% accuracy score.
